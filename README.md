The project analyzes the relationship between economic indicators and waste generation using data from the [2021 UNEP Food Waste Index Report](</extras/FWD%20(1).xlsx>).

## `Non-technical explanation of our findings`

Our exploration of the relationship between economic indicators and global waste generation patterns yielded several insights. The dataset, covering diverse countries, allowed us to observe trends and variations in economic factors and waste production.

## Key Findings:

The overall model does not explain a significant proportion of the variance in the total waste estimate (R-squared = 0.156). Additionally, individual economic indicators do not exhibit strong statistical significance in predicting the total waste production.

1. **Working Hours and Wages:**
   - Standard working week averages around 38.2 hours.
   - Monthly minimum wages vary from 170 to 3298.4 USD.

2. **Financial Indicators:**
   - Lending rates average at 6.03%.
   - GDP per capita averages at 57.90 thousand USD.

3. **Human Development Index (HDI):**
   - Average HDI is 0.894.

4. **Waste Production:**
   - Total waste production ranges from 38.8 thousand tonnes to 45.4 million tonnes.

## `Levels of Certainty`

While expressing moderate to high confidence in our findings, it's crucial to acknowledge potential uncertainties associated with data limitations, assumptions, and sampling variability.

## `Technical description of analysis`

Results of the data analysis conducted using Jupyter Notebook can be found [**here**](/milestone/milestone_3/total_analysis.ipynb).

## `Technical explanation of our findings`

### Key Findings and Insights

1. **Household Food Waste Across Regions:**
   - Poland and the USA exhibit similar per capita household food waste.
   - Canada and Denmark show higher estimates, indicating advanced waste management systems.

2. **Global Economic Impact of Food Waste:**
   - Global average food waste volume is around 3.17 million tonnes.
   - Higher development level countries like the USA have larger volumes of food waste.

3. **Relationship Between Economic Prosperity and Food Waste Reduction Initiatives:**
   - Sensitivity to economic indicators suggests regions with higher economic development may have more resources for waste reduction initiatives.
   - Supplementary research is recommended for a comprehensive understanding.

## `Possible Alternative Approaches`

1. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Explore models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for predictive modeling.

2. **Robust Regression:**
   - Consider robust regression techniques like Huber regression to address potential outliers.

3. **Advanced Geospatial Techniques:**
   - Utilize advanced geospatial analysis techniques for deeper insights into regional waste distribution patterns.

### Applying the Results:

The findings can be used for further research and development of waste management strategies in the context of economic development.
