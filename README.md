# Zero Waste Initiative

## Overview

Zero Waste offers a systematic approach to avoiding or reusing waste with the aim of minimizing its disposal into landfills. It's a strategic resource management paradigm that is becoming increasingly relevant in today's world, where the need for sustainable development and efficient resource utilization is evident.



# Milestone 0: Problem Identification
**Date: 8-19 January, 2024**


## Core Issues

- **Technological Innovations:** What new technologies can be utilized for waste collection, sorting, and processing to achieve zero waste?
- **Educational Programs:** How can public awareness regarding the importance of Zero Waste programs be raised and encourage the adoption of new eco-friendly habits?
- **Waste Management in Cities:** What urban management strategies can facilitate the successful implementation of Zero Waste programs in large cities?


## Generating Ideas and Making Progress

Brainstorm new and creative solutions to reduce waste and promote zero waste initiatives. Test these ideas through simulations or small-scale projects to evaluate effectiveness. Continuously iterate and refine solutions based on feedback from participants and data analysis. Ensure that all solutions are user-friendly, culturally appropriate, and considerate of all stakeholders' perspectives.


## Methodology

- **Understanding People:** Gather insights from personal experiences and data obtained from open sources to analyze stakeholders' perspectives on waste management.
- **Defining the Issue:** Analyze statements from various stakeholder groups to identify key challenges and opportunities in waste management.
- **Generating Ideas and Making Progress:** Engage in collaborative brainstorming sessions to devise innovative solutions. Test these ideas through simulations or small-scale projects, continuously iterating based on feedback and data analysis.

## üå± Problem Statement

While Zero Waste programs have a positive environmental impact, there are certain challenges that complicate their implementation and effectiveness. For instance, cultural and geographical differences may hinder the adoption of new consumption practices and waste management strategies.


## Understanding of the Problem Domain

ZeroWaste practices in the food industry, including restaurants and delivery services, are paramount to reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability. However, significant challenges persist in implementing effective ZeroWaste strategies across diverse sectors of the food industry.


## Region of overview

Our team working with data and analysis globally but with acent on countries where we currently live.



# Milestone 2: Problem Identification
**Date: 29 January - 2 February, 2024**


## Milestone overview:


## Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

- **Approach:** Our way of understanding migration patterns in post-conflict regions involves looking at various aspects like social and economic conditions, the dynamics of conflict, and changes in demographics. We're taking a thorough approach, combining insights from experts in the field and considering both hard data and real-world experiences. This helps us build models that reflect the intricate nature of migration, going beyond just numbers.

- **Limitations:** While our approach is comprehensive, potential flaws may include challenges in quantifying certain qualitative aspects. Additionally, biases in available data sources could impact the accuracy of our models.


## Data Set Documentation

We linked to datasets from USDA, FeedAmerica and UN organizations. We use dataset from USDA, UN, NGOs. It is give us wide and big picture of our related problems.
