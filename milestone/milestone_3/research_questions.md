# Data Analysis Results

### `Upon conducting a thorough analysis and examining our results, the subsequent findings have next answers and conclusions to our project questions: `

## Question 1 : What is the average per capita household food waste in the studied region, and how does it vary across different income brackets or urban and rural areas?

### Average per capita household food waste in the studied region
| Region/Country | Household estimate (kg/capita/year) |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Poland | 56 |
| Canada | 79 |
| USA | 59 |
| Denmark | 81 |
| Germany | 73 |

### Urban area conclusion:

- Higher income typically implies higher waste: Studies suggest a positive correlation between income and household food waste. Wealthier individuals may purchase more food than needed, lack awareness or resources for efficient management, or prioritize convenience over minimizing waste.

- Urban areas often see higher waste: Faster-paced lifestyles, reliance on processed foods, and limited storage facilities in urban environments can contribute to higher waste compared to rural areas with closer access to fresh produce and potentially different consumption patterns.

### Rural area conclusion:

- Lower-income households might be more mindful of food waste due to budget constraints, and they may be more likely to use leftovers creatively.

- Rural areas may have different patterns influenced by agricultural practices, self-sufficiency, and potentially less access to a wide range of perishable goods.

## Question 2 : What is the collective economic impact of food waste on a global scale, and how does it affect different regions economically?

Quantifying the exact collective economic impact of food waste on a global scale is challenging due to the multifaceted nature of the issue and variations in data reporting. However, numerous studies suggest that food waste has substantial economic repercussions worldwide.

On a global scale, it is estimated that the economic cost of food waste encompasses expenses incurred throughout the entire supply chain, from production and distribution to consumption and disposal. These costs include agricultural inputs, transportation, storage, and waste management expenses. Moreover, the environmental impact of food waste, such as greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing organic matter in landfills, further compounds economic challenges.

The economic effects of food waste vary across regions. In economically advanced regions, such as North America and Europe, the financial burden is significant due to high levels of consumption and waste generation. Conversely, in developing regions, economic losses may stem from inefficiencies in production, storage, and transportation, with limited resources available to address these challenges.

Food waste can also contribute to economic disparities within countries. Urban areas tend to generate more food waste, leading to increased disposal costs and environmental concerns, while rural areas may face losses earlier in the supply chain due to inadequate infrastructure.

Efforts to reduce food waste can positively impact economies globally by promoting resource efficiency, reducing production costs, and creating opportunities for innovation and job creation in waste reduction technologies. Addressing food waste on a global scale requires coordinated efforts, considering regional variations in economic structures, consumption patterns, and infrastructure development.


## Question 3 : Are there correlations between the economic prosperity of a region and its success in implementing effective food waste reduction initiatives?


The relationship between economic prosperity and the success of food waste reduction initiatives is multifaceted. While wealthier regions often possess advantages such as greater financial resources, advanced technology, and efficient supply chains, the success of food waste reduction is not solely determined by economic prosperity. Factors such as education, awareness, cultural attitudes, and effective policies play pivotal roles.

Addressing food waste requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach, involving governments, businesses, communities, and individuals. Even in economically prosperous regions, the effectiveness of initiatives depends on the commitment to sustainable practices, the implementation of sound policies, and the engagement of all stakeholders in the food supply chain.

It is essential to recognize that successful food waste reduction is a global challenge that requires tailored solutions considering the unique circumstances of each region. By fostering a holistic understanding of the interconnected factors influencing food waste, regions can work towards building resilient and sustainable systems that contribute to both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship.
