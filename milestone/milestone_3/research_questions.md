## Question 1: Average Per Capita Household Food Waste

### Average Per Capita Household Food Waste in the Studied Region

| Region/Country | Household Estimate (kg/capita/year) |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Poland         | 56                                  |
| Canada         | 79                                  |
| USA            | 59                                  |
| Denmark        | 81                                  |
| Germany        | 73                                  |

### Urban Area Conclusion:

- **Higher Income Implies More Waste:** Studies suggest a positive correlation between income and household food waste. Wealthier individuals may purchase more food than needed, lack awareness or resources for efficient management, or prioritize convenience over minimizing waste.
- **Urban Areas Experience Higher Waste:** The fast-paced lifestyle, reliance on processed foods, and limited storage facilities in urban environments contribute to higher waste compared to rural areas with closer access to fresh produce and potentially different consumption patterns.

### Rural Area Conclusion:

- **Lower-Income Households May Be More Mindful:** Budget constraints may make lower-income households more mindful of food waste, and they may creatively use leftovers.
- **Rural Areas Exhibit Different Patterns:** Influenced by agricultural practices, self-sufficiency, and potentially less access to a wide range of perishable goods.

### Additional Analysis for Question 1:

Average household food waste per capita varies significantly across countries and regions. Poland and the USA have similar levels, while Germany and Ukraine show moderately elevated values. Canada and Denmark surpass others, indicating higher estimates of household waste per capita per year. This suggests advanced waste collection and processing systems, potentially due to effective waste sorting and recycling programs and a responsible population attitude towards environmental issues in Canada and Denmark.

Furthermore, examining the distribution of food service expenditures across various countries, the United States leads in expenditures, while Germany and Denmark, as well as Poland and Canada, exhibit similarities in consumption patterns. Ukraine stands out with substantial food service expenditures, underscoring diverse consumption habits influenced by food consumption strategies and variations in legislative landscapes, highlighting varying policy needs for waste management from food services.

Regarding retail waste estimates, Germany has the lowest retail waste, while Canada and Poland exhibit moderate values. The United States and Ukraine show slightly higher retail waste, but Denmark stands out with significantly higher levels. Denmark's unique profile is influenced by factors such as limited local production, a substantial amount of imported perishable goods, and higher average affluence leading to increased food waste. Overall, the analysis emphasizes diverse patterns in retail waste, reflecting variations in consumption habits and waste management practices among the studied countries.

## Question 2: Collective Economic Impact of Food Waste on a Global Scale

### Analytical Results Overview:

**1. Volume of Food Waste Production:**

- The global average volume of food waste production is estimated at approximately 3.17 million tonnes.
- This significant volume contributes to substantial economic losses, primarily through devaluation of products and inefficient resource utilization.

**2. Regional Disparities:**

- Categorizing countries by their level of economic development reveals notable differences.
- Higher development level countries (e.g., USA, Netherlands) tend to exhibit a larger volume of food waste compared to lower development level countries (e.g., Ukraine, Portugal).

**3. Economic Indicators and Food Waste:**

- Regression analysis shows that economic indicators, including average weekly working hours and minimum wages, have a limited impact on predicting food waste volumes.
- While not strong predictors, these factors remain relevant in the overall analysis.

**4. Correlations:**

- Correlation analysis indicates associations between various economic indicators and the production of food waste.
- For instance, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to generate more food waste, suggesting a complex relationship.

### Additional Insights:

In conclusion, the global economic impact of food waste extends beyond mere volume considerations. It involves substantial losses in product value, resource inefficiency, and increased expenditures on transportation and storage. Regional disparities, influenced by economic development levels, play a crucial role in determining the volumes of food waste. Economic indicators, though not dominant predictors, interact with induced food waste. These insights emphasize the multifaceted nature of the economic impact of food waste on a global scale, requiring comprehensive strategies for mitigation.

## Question 3 : Are there correlations between the economic prosperity of a region and its success in implementing effective food waste reduction initiatives?

The relationship between economic prosperity and the success of food waste reduction initiatives is multifaceted. While wealthier regions often possess advantages such as greater financial resources, advanced technology, and efficient supply chains, the success of food waste reduction is not solely determined by economic prosperity. Factors such as education, awareness, cultural attitudes, and effective policies play pivotal roles.

Addressing food waste requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach, involving governments, businesses, communities, and individuals. Even in economically prosperous regions, the effectiveness of initiatives depends on the commitment to sustainable practices, the implementation of sound policies, and the engagement of all stakeholders in the food supply chain.

It is essential to recognize that successful food waste reduction is a global challenge that requires tailored solutions considering the unique circumstances of each region. By fostering a holistic understanding of the interconnected factors influencing food waste, regions can work towards building resilient and sustainable systems that contribute to both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship.
