Based on the analysis conducted for the following countries: Denmark, Germany, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Poland, and Ukraine, the following conclusions were drawn:

## Denmark

- Expected reduction in total waste compared to 2023: 5-6.8%

## Germany

- Expected reduction in total waste compared to 2023: 3.4-3.8%

## Canada

- Expected reduction in total waste compared to 2023: 2.15-2.35%

## USA

- Expected reduction in total waste compared to 2023: 1.8-2.4%

## Ukraine

- Expected reduction in total waste compared to 2023: 1-1.2%

## Poland

- Expected reduction in total waste compared to 2023: 4.1-4.8%

These conclusions are based on data obtained from open sources that were researched. It appears that each country is expected to experience a reduction in total waste compared to the year 2023, with varying percentages.

However, it's crucial to note that these conclusions are subject to additional considerations. The differences between expected reductions and model predictions may be attributed to factors such as the introduction of recent emission reduction programs in the food industry and potential data quality issues. These aspects were highlighted in further analysis, indicating that the model's predictions might not fully capture the dynamic nature of the waste reduction landscape.
