### Correlation Analysis: Economic Indicators and Waste Generation

In the provided correlation matrix, we explore the relationships between various economic indicators and waste generation estimates. The correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1:

- **Strong Positive Correlation (Close to 1):** Indicates a direct relationship where an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in the other.
- **Strong Negative Correlation (Close to -1):** Indicates an inverse relationship where an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other.
- **Weak Correlation (Close to 0):** Suggests a weak or no linear relationship between the variables.

## Key Observations:

### Average Weekly Working Hours:

- Negatively correlated with Monthly Minimum Wages (Euro), GDP Per Capita (USD), and Human Development Index.
- Weak positive correlation with Lending Rate (%).

### Monthly Minimum Wages (Euro):

- Strong positive correlation with GDP Per Capita (USD) and Human Development Index.
- Negative correlation with Average Weekly Working Hours.

### Lending Rate (%):

- Weak positive correlation with Average Weekly Working Hours and weak negative correlation with GDP Per Capita (USD) and Human Development Index.

### GDP Per Capita (USD):

- Strong positive correlation with Monthly Minimum Wages (Euro) and Human Development Index.
- Negative correlation with Average Weekly Working Hours.

### Human Development Index:

- Strong positive correlation with Monthly Minimum Wages (Euro) and positive correlations with GDP Per Capita (USD).

### Waste Estimates:

- Strong positive correlations among different waste types (household, food service, retail) and total waste estimate.
- Positive correlation with economic indicators, suggesting that more economically developed countries tend to generate more waste.

These findings offer insights into the interplay between economic factors and waste generation patterns, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## OLS Regression Analysis Results

### Overview:

The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression results provide insights into the relationship between various economic indicators and the total estimate of waste production in tonnes per year.

### Key Statistics:

- **R-squared:** 0.156
- **Adjusted R-squared:** 0.015
- **F-statistic:** 1.106
- **Prob (F-statistic):** 0.378
- **Log-Likelihood:** -618.09
- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):** 1248
- **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion):** 1258

### Coefficients and Significance:

1. **Constant:**

   - Coefficient: -5.596e+06
   - P-value: 0.930
   - Interpretation: The constant term is not statistically significant.

2. **Average Weekly Working Hours:**

   - Coefficient: -1.097e+06
   - P-value: 0.163
   - Interpretation: The average weekly working hours have a negative impact on the total waste estimate, but the relationship is not statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.

3. **Monthly Minimum Wages (Euro):**

   - Coefficient: -6752.2463
   - P-value: 0.055
   - Interpretation: Monthly minimum wages show a negative impact on the total waste estimate, and the relationship approaches statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level.

4. **Lending Rate (%):**

   - Coefficient: 1.092e+05
   - P-value: 0.842
   - Interpretation: Lending rate does not show a statistically significant impact on the total waste estimate.

5. **GDP Per Capita (USD):**

   - Coefficient: 5.984e+04
   - P-value: 0.429
   - Interpretation: GDP per capita does not show a statistically significant impact on the total waste estimate.

6. **Human Development Index:**
   - Coefficient: 6.289e+07
   - P-value: 0.281
   - Interpretation: The Human Development Index does not show a statistically significant impact on the total waste estimate.

### Overall Conclusion:

The overall model does not explain a significant proportion of the variance in the total waste estimate (R-squared = 0.156). Additionally, individual economic indicators do not exhibit strong statistical significance in predicting the total waste production.

It's crucial to note that the large condition number (1.08e+05) may indicate potential issues with multicollinearity or other numerical problems in the model.
