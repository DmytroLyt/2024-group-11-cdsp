# Economic Indicators and Waste Generation Dataset

## Overview

### Dataset Source

The dataset comprises estimates of household, food service, and retail waste per country, extracted from the 2021 UNEP Food Waste Index Report. It encompasses information on waste generation, confidence levels, and economic indicators such as GDP per capita, lending rates, and more.

### Data Integrity Considerations

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identified and addressed missing values through normalization or removal.
2. **Ensuring Data Consistency:**
   - Verified and standardized data types and formats for consistency.
3. **Addressing Outliers:**
   - Explored and mitigated outliers that could impact analysis results.

### Research Significance

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying the relationship between economic indicators and waste generation patterns globally. Researchers can gain insights into variations, trends, and the reliability of waste estimates.

## Data Fields

   - Categorized countries based on economic development levels.
5. **Graphical Analysis:**
   - Used graphical representations to analyze relationships.
6. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Conducted regression analysis for predicting waste generation levels.
7. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Visualized waste distribution across regions using geospatial maps.
8. **Sectoral Comparison:**
   - Compared waste generation levels across sectors.
9. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - Applied time series forecasting for future waste trends.
