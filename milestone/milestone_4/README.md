# Milestone 4: Communicating Results

### **Date: 19 February - 2 March, 2024**

## Milestone overview:

## Selecting the Target Audience:

Our focus is on Nonprofit Organizations dedicated to addressing social and environmental issues, specifically in the realm of food waste. We aim to engage organizations with significant influence on groups contributing to food waste, such as households, food service, and retail.

## Strategies for Nonprofit Organizations to Reduce Food Waste:

- Promoting conscious consumption: Organizations can conduct information campaigns and educational activities for consumers on healthy eating, responsible food handling and minimizing wastage.
- Supporting restaurants and catering establishments: Organizations can promote the implementation of programs for the storage and use of leftovers in restaurants and other food service establishments.
- Developing food recycling programs: Nonprofit organizations can promote the development of food recycling programs at food service locations. Be proactive in increasing the number of garbage cans in cities and providing them with biodegradable bags to encourage separate waste sorting and recycling.
- Establish partnerships with grocery stores and food suppliers: Organizations can partner with grocery stores and food providers to reduce food rejection and wastage.
- Support local initiatives to distribute free food: Organizations can organize programs to collect and distribute leftover food to local social service agencies or individuals in need.
- Develop technology to track and manage leftover food: Nonprofits can develop or support the development of technologies to help track and manage leftover food at various points in the supply chain.
- Political and public lobbying: Organizations can engage in lobbying for legislative changes or the development of community initiatives to reduce food waste.
- Monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring and evaluating the level of food waste in their sectors and jointly developing strategies to reduce it.
- Sponsoring educational programs: Supporting educational programs aimed at raising awareness of food waste.

## Limitations:

- Financial Limitations: Non-profit organizations may have limited financial resources to participate in projects.
- Resource constraints: Some organizations may have limited resources to actively participate in projects.
- Partnership Opportunities: Nonprofit organizations can find new opportunities to collaborate and develop their activities.

## Cooperation Strategies:

Direct Appeal: We will approach non-profit organizations directly, offering cooperation and sharing resources to achieve a common goal.
Partnerships: Establishing partnerships with organizations, including sharing knowledge, resources and expertise.
Organizing Events: Holding joint events, workshops and trainings with non-profit organizations to raise awareness and collaboration in reducing food waste.

## The final decision

How we will present to them: a poster or a Power Point presentation (to be decided after Monday's workshop).
