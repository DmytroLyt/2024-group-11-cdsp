# Milestone 4: Communicating Results

### **Date: 19 February - 2 March, 2024**

## Milestone overview:

## Selecting the Target Audience:

Our focus is on Nonprofit Organizations dedicated to addressing social and environmental issues, specifically in the realm of food waste. We aim to engage organizations with significant influence on groups contributing to food waste, such as households, food service, and retail.

## Strategies for Nonprofit Organizations to Reduce Food Waste:

**Promoting Conscious Consumption:**
- Tailor information campaigns based on country-specific waste patterns identified in the analysis.
- Emphasize the importance of healthy eating aligned with waste assessment data.
**Supporting Restaurants and Catering Establishments:**
- Advocate for tailored programs in regions exhibiting higher waste estimates.
- Implement strategies considering variations in food service waste management practices.
**Developing Food Recycling Programs:**
- Propose city-specific initiatives, emphasizing variations in waste production and legislative landscapes identified in the analysis.
**Establishing Partnerships with Grocery Stores and Food Suppliers:**
- Encourage collaborations, leveraging insights on waste variations and patterns within grocery stores and food providers.
**Supporting Local Initiatives to Distribute Free Food:**
- Tailor programs based on country-specific attitudes toward food loss, focusing on regions with higher waste estimates.
**Developing Technology to Track and Manage Leftover Food:**
- Highlight the importance of technology, aligning proposals with machine learning modeling insights for waste reduction.
**Political and Public Lobbying:**
- Use specific data to support lobbying efforts, emphasizing legislative changes based on waste variations within regions.
**Monitoring and Evaluation:**
- Encourage organizations to adopt analytical approaches for waste reduction, considering regional waste disparities.
**Sponsoring Educational Programs:**
- Support educational initiatives informed by research on socio-cultural and technological aspects influencing food waste.

## Data Requests for Nonprofit Organizations:

**_Our project analysis was carried out based on the latest public information found in various sources. The limit year of information found is 2021. We need the latest data from 2022 onwards, namely:_**

- **Detailed Yearly Waste Breakdown:** Requesting country-specific, year-wise waste production data to enhance the precision of our analysis and predictions.
- **Recent Emission Reduction Programs Data:** Soliciting information on recent emission reduction programs in the food industry to understand their potential influence on waste reduction predictions.
- **Socio-Cultural Factors Influencing Food Waste:** Requesting data related to socio-cultural factors affecting food waste behaviors in different countries for a more nuanced analysis.
- **Country-Specific Waste Reduction Strategies:** Seeking information on country-specific waste reduction strategies or policies, including their implementation timelines and observed impacts.
- **Machine Learning Model Training Data:** If applicable, requesting additional training data for our machine learning model, particularly specific year-wise data, to enhance its predictive capabilities.
- **Environmental Footprint Reduction Metrics:** Seeking data or metrics quantifying the reduction of the environmental footprint achieved through successful waste management practices.
- **Regional Variations in Consumption Patterns:** Inquiring about data highlighting regional variations in food consumption patterns to improve the accuracy of our waste trend analysis.
- **Impact Reports from Collective Initiatives:** Requesting reports or studies outlining the impact of collective initiatives on food waste reduction for empirical evidence supporting collaborative efforts.

## Limitations:

- **Financial Limitations:** Nonprofit organizations may have limited financial resources.
- **Resource Constraints:** Some organizations may face resource limitations.
- **Partnership Opportunities:** Identifying new opportunities for collaboration and development.

## Cooperation Strategies:

- **Direct Appeal:** Approach nonprofit organizations directly, offering cooperation and resource sharing.
- **Partnerships:** Establish partnerships with organizations, sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise.
- **Organizing Events:** Hold joint events, workshops, and trainings to raise awareness and foster collaboration in reducing food waste.

## Communication Artifact:

**PowerPoint Presentation**
In our upcoming presentation about reducing food waste, we'll cover the main problem we're tackling and why it matters. We'll introduce the audience we're focusing on and explain why we chose them. Then, we'll talk about our chosen way of sharing information and why we think it's the best fit. Moving on to our research process, we'll share if our original questions stayed the same or if we made any changes and why. Following that, we'll spill the beans on what we discovered (or didn't discover) in response to our research questions, along with any surprises we encountered. This approach aims to give a straightforward overview of our research journey, addressing the problem, audience, artifact, and research process.
