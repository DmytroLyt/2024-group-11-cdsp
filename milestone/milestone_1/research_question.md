# Actionable Research Questions

During the project, we reviewed our trajectory and, guided by our datasets, opted to refine our questions by making them more specific and focused.



1. What is the average per capita household food waste in the studied region, and how does it vary across different income brackets or urban and rural areas?
2. What is the collective economic impact of food waste on a global scale, and how does it affect different regions economically?
3. Are there correlations between the economic prosperity of a region and its success in implementing effective food waste reduction initiatives?



## Are there differences in approaches to Zero Waste programs in different regions of the world? Do geographical, cultural, and other factors influence the success of such programs?

1. Legislative acts and policy documents: Data on legislation and political strategies regarding "Zero Waste" in different countries, such as laws, government decrees, national waste management strategies, etc.
2. Waste statistics: Data on the volumes of waste production and disposal in different countries. This may include data on the amount of waste recycled, waste per capita, etc.
3. Zero Waste program data: Information on implemented "Zero Waste" programs in different countries, including their goals, strategies, outcomes, and effectiveness.
4. Sociocultural data: Data on cultural peculiarities, consumer habits, and attitudes towards environmental issues in different countries, which may influence the adoption and implementation of "Zero Waste" policies.
5. Economic data: Information on the economic costs and benefits of implementing "Zero Waste" policies in different countries.
6. Innovation and technology data: Information on innovative approaches and technologies used in "Zero Waste" programs in different countries.

## Considering the vast amount of data associated with this topic, we had to limit the data we will use for our research:

1. Distribution of wasted products in households by categories in percentage or weight: We will analyze the breakdown of wasted products in households, categorizing them by percentage or weight.

2. Average level of losses in primary production in selected food sectors (e.g., bakery products, vegetables, meat products, etc.): We will assess the typical loss rates during primary production in various food sectors, such as bakery products, vegetables, meat products, and others. We can also compare these losses across different sectors.

3. Trend of wasted food products from ... year to ... year: We will examine the trend of wasted food products over a specified period, from one year to another, to identify any patterns or changes.

4. Quantity of wasted products in restaurants and catering events: We will quantify the amount of wasted products in restaurants and catering events to understand the scale of food waste in these settings.

5. Main reasons why people discard food: We will investigate the primary reasons why individuals discard food, identifying common factors contributing to food waste.

6. Measures to prevent food waste (mobile applications, municipal/private programs, etc.): We will explore various measures aimed at preventing food waste, including the use of mobile applications, municipal or private programs, and other initiatives.
