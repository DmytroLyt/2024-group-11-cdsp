## Actionable Research Questions

During the project, we reviewed our trajectory and, guided by our datasets, opted to refine our questions by making them more specific and focused.

~~1. What effective methods can integrate cultural and geographical differences into Zero Waste programs?~~

~~2. What strategies for incentivizing innovation in waste management can ensure greater success of Zero Waste programs?~~

~~3. What evaluation tools can be applied to measure the effectiveness of Zero Waste programs and their impact on the environment?~~

1. What is the average per capita household food waste in the studied region, and how does it vary across different income brackets or urban and rural areas?
2. What is the collective economic impact of food waste on a global scale, and how does it affect different regions economically?
3. Are there correlations between the economic prosperity of a region and its success in implementing effective food waste reduction initiatives?

## ðŸŒ± Problem Statement

While Zero Waste programs have a positive environmental impact, there are certain challenges that complicate their implementation and effectiveness. For instance, cultural and geographical differences may hinder the adoption of new consumption practices and waste management strategies.

## Understanding of the Problem Domain

ZeroWaste practices in the food industry, including restaurants and delivery services, are paramount to reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability. However, significant challenges persist in implementing effective ZeroWaste strategies across diverse sectors of the food industry.
