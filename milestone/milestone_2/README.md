## Milestone overview:

## Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

Domain modeling in our Zero Waste project involves creating a simplified, yet comprehensive representation of the key aspects related to waste management. Think of it as a way to visually capture the essential elements and relationships within the system we're addressing. In our case, this includes understanding how various factors such as economic indicators, cultural differences, and geographical aspects influence waste generation and management practices.

Imagine it as a map that helps us navigate the complexities of waste reduction strategies. We identify the major landmarks, like economic development and cultural norms, and map out the connections between them. This visual guide aids us in developing a clear understanding of how these elements interact and impact our overall goal of achieving Zero Waste.

By having this non-technical model, we're better equipped to communicate insights, spot potential challenges, and guide our decision-making process. It's like having a simplified blueprint that allows us to see the bigger picture and make informed choices on the most effective strategies to reduce waste and promote sustainability.

## Data Set Documentation

We linked to datasets from USDA, FeedAmerica and UN organizations. We use dataset from USDA, UN, NGOs. It is give us wide and big picture of our related problems.

## Data Collection and Cleaning Scripts

To ensure transparency and the ability to replicate our work, we have provided all scripts for data collection and cleaning in our directory. This encompasses the entire process, including the partitioning of data into training and validation sets.

## Our Research Work

Our team is engaged in research in the field of Data Science, focusing on the implementation of zero waste programs. Learning from practical experience and utilizing modern data analysis methods, we aim to develop our skills and make a significant contribution to this field.
