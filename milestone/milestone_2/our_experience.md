My experience with Zero Waste includes studying and adapting best practices, particularly those used in Denmark. Denmark is known for its advanced environmental policy and sustainable development efforts, especially in combating waste in the food and restaurant sectors.

1. One of the key methods I've learned about is the use of the Too Good To Go service. This service, widely used in Denmark, offers a mobile application connecting customers with restaurants and stores that have surplus unsold food. Through this app, users can purchase sets of products or dishes that would otherwise be discarded at the end of the workday according to technological processes.

2. Additionally, Denmark has a large network of volunteer organizations that actively assist in food sharing. These organizations play an important role in reducing waste and promoting social interaction and cooperation within local communities.

3. Recently, I attended a FoodSharing Startup Event, where volunteers gathered to share experiences, listen to proposals, and discuss plans for the next quarter. This event further inspired me to actively participate in initiatives aimed at reducing waste and promoting Zero Waste practices within my local community.

In Afghanistan, despite challenges stemming from poor infrastructure and limited investments in waste recycling, there exists a vibrant culture of food waste management driven by grassroots initiatives and entrepreneurial endeavors. My personal experiences in this domain have provided insights into the innovative ways in which waste food is repurposed and recycled to minimize environmental impact and contribute to sustainable practices.

1. Composting Waste Fruits and Vegetables:
In Afghanistan, waste fruits and vegetables serve as a significant source for producing compost, which plays a crucial role in supporting bio agriculture. Despite the absence of sophisticated recycling facilities, individuals and communities engage in composting practices, leveraging organic waste to enrich soil fertility. This grassroots approach to composting not only diverts organic waste from landfills but also promotes sustainable agricultural practices, contributing to food security and environmental conservation.

2. Utilizing Waste Bread for Animal Feed:
Another noteworthy practice in food waste management in Afghanistan involves repurposing waste bread as a complementary feed for farm animals. In a country where bread holds cultural and dietary significance, minimizing bread waste is paramount. Instead of discarding surplus or stale bread, it is collected and repurposed as a nutritious feed supplement for livestock. This innovative approach not only reduces food waste but also provides a sustainable solution to address the nutritional needs of farm animals, particularly in rural areas where access to commercial feed may be limited.

3. Entrepreneurial Initiatives in Waste Management:
Beyond traditional practices, entrepreneurial ventures have emerged to address food waste management challenges in Afghanistan. Startups and social enterprises have leveraged innovative technologies and business models to tackle food waste at various stages of the supply chain. From surplus food redistribution platforms to initiatives focusing on converting organic waste into value-added products like compost or biogas, these ventures contribute to both environmental sustainability and economic development.

4. Socio-Cultural Context and Community Participation:
The success of food waste management initiatives in Afghanistan is deeply rooted in socio-cultural norms and community participation. Practices such as composting and bread redistribution are not only environmentally beneficial but also resonate with local traditions of resourcefulness and frugality. Moreover, community-led efforts to address food insecurity and promote sustainable agriculture underscore the intrinsic connection between waste management and broader socio-economic development goals.

I have experience of Zero Waste in couple countries and in couple states across USA. My latest experience about Massachusetts state. State launched Solid Waste Master Plan, the document establishes goals to reduce disposal statewide by 30 percent (from 5.7 million tons in 2018 to 4 million tons in 2030) over the next decade. It sets a long-term goal of achieving a 90 percent reduction in disposal to 570,000 tons by 2050. 

Here I want to provide of some interesting key points for becoming zero waste for my opinion:

1. Refuse – Say no to disposable single-use plastic, coffee cups, utensils, straws, shopping bags, and anything that you could replace with a reusable option. For more suggestions of disposable products that you can replace with reusable or eco-friendly options, read 43 Ways to Reduce Your Plastic Disposable Waste. 

2. Reduce – Be mindful of what you buy. Purchase only what you need and limit impulse purchases. Buy secondhand items whenever possible for clothing, furniture, etc. Learn more about ways to reduce how many new clothes you buy.

3. Reuse – Before you throw something out, think about whether you could repair or reuse it for another purpose. Breathe new life into old pieces of furniture or donate these items. Visit Beyond the Bin to find a local donation center. For old clothes, swap parties are gaining in popularity. Go through your closet, gather a group of friends, and do a swap rather than a shop! 

4. Recycle – While recycling isn’t fully sustainable, it’s better than sending recyclable materials to landfills and incinerators. To ensure you are recycling correctly, visit the RecycleSmartMA website to access their Recyclopedia tool. 

5. Rot – Compost! It doesn’t matter if you live in a tiny apartment in the city or on a ten-acre farm, composting options are available to you. About 26% of the waste stream in Massachusetts is composed of organic waste. Composting reduces the volume of waste going to landfills or waste-to-energy incinerators.

My experience in the project related to Zero Waste is researching and finding solutions to the problem of food wastage in Poland, the country in which I currently live. I research a lot of statistics and learn about interesting services and organizations, legislative measures aimed at preventing food waste. It gave me an understanding of the importance of conscious consumption and the application of zero waste practices in everyday life.

1. With the help of this data, I found out that the main food products that Poles most often throw into the trash are 
 bakery products - 52%,
 vegetables - 36%;
 fruits - 38%;
 meat products - 32%;
 dairy products - 17%. 

2. The main reasons for wasting food are:
missing the expiration date - 29%;
lack of a list of necessary products - 20%;
excessive purchases - 20%;
excessively large portions of food - 15%.

3. One of the ways to reduce food waste in Poland is to use the Too Good to Go and Foodsi services. These services allow people to purchase unsold food from stores and restaurants at a significantly reduced price. This allows stores to avoid throwing food away and helps reduce food waste.

4. There are 31 food banks in Poland that collect and distribute unsold but still edible food. These organizations help to avoid food wastage and provide hungry people with the necessary food.

5. Another important method is the law on the prevention of food waste in Poland. According to this law, stores with a floor space of more than 250 square meters must donate unused but still usable food to public organizations that provide assistance to those in need. These can be charitable organizations, public kitchens, charitable institutions and other institutions working in the field of social assistance.

6. Understanding the problem of food waste inspires me to make changes in my consumer behavior and helps me to develop a more responsible and environmentally friendly approach to eating and  motivated me to engage proactively in endeavors dedicated to minimizing waste and advocating for Zero Waste principles within my immediate social sphere.
