## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Project documentation: Rigorous work on project documentation was carried out in accordance with the guidance provided by the learning facilitator, ensuring a thorough and well-documented project framework.
- Successful Audience Selection: As expected, the careful consideration of our target audience, based on a comprehensive profile, allows us to build a presentation that effectively communicates key metrics thoroughly analyzed during the project.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Individual Contribution Showcase: The initial plan did not adequately highlight individual contributions and efforts within the team, which caused some concern within the team.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Streamlined Presentation Design: The incorporation of a ready-made template for the final presentation will simplify the process of choosing the right layout that meets all requirements and needs.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Leveraging Provided Template: Using the template provided by the learning facilitator, eliminates the need to worry about styles, fonts, and presentation sections. This decision simplifies the process, saving time and effort while ensuring a polished and professional look.
