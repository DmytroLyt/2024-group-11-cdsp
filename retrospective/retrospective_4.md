## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Persona Development: The plan to create personas for our target audience went as expected, providing valuable insights into their preferences and communication styles.
- Diversified Communication Channels: Exploring various communication channels to reach our audience was successful, allowing us to adapt our approach based on their accessibility and preferences.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Initial Communication Draft: The first version of our communication material didn't quite connect technical details with simpler language, so we had to make some changes to make it clearer.
- Feedback Implementation Delay: Getting feedback takes time, and that affected how quickly we could make our communication better.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Visual Communication Enhancement: Additional steps for enhancing visual communication were added to improve accessibility and understanding for a broader audience.
- Enriched Performance Metrics: Several indicators were incorporated to bridge the technical and non-technical aspects of the project more effectively, fostering a comprehensive understanding.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Prioritized Feedback Implementation: Prioritized the implementation of critical feedback from non-technical stakeholders to ensure timely improvements in our communication.
- Targeted feedback to the team: Need to provide constructive feedback to team 12, based on the created documentation.
