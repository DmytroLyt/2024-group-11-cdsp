# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Postponing the formulation of questions.
- Asking questions without clear direction or goals.

## Continue Doing

- Actively engaging in formulating questions and considering various aspects of the project.
- Involving different stakeholders in the question formulation process.

## Start Doing

- Paying attention to different perspectives and sources of information for question formulation.
- Using tools to assess the importance and relevance of each question.

## Lessons Learned

- The importance of a systematic and goal-oriented approach to question formulation.
- The necessity of continuously improving methods and processes for question formulation.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Repository Setup: The establishment of our project repository, including the project board, branch protections, pull request template, milestones, and slack group, went as expected. This laid a solid foundation for our collaborative work and project management.

- Group Planning Documents: The creation of group planning documents, such as group norms, learning goals, constraints, and a communication plan, was executed smoothly. These documents will guide our team throughout the project and ensure clear communication and alignment with our objectives.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Problem Statement Development: While our problem-statement was based on personal experiences, refining it to align more closely with systems thinking and design thinking proved to be a challenge. This is an area we recognize needs further attention and refinement.

- Actionable Research Question: The formulation of an actionable research question proved to be more complex and wider than anticipated. Achieving a question that is both realistic within our constraints and aligned with the complexities of food waste requires further iteration.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Organizing: We just came up with a strategy, no further things are required.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Reasearch: At the current stage, we need to focus on the collecting information, and in the process of encountering problems, improve and refine our steps.
