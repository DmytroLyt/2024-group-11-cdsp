## Stop Doing

- Stop creating overly complex documentation, aim for clarity and simplicity to enhance understanding.
- Stop skipping some tasks in project.

## Continue Doing

- Continue the practice of thorough code reviews, which has contributed to the overall code quality.
- Proactively discuss and make proposal about some tasks and team work.

## Start Doing

- Start implementing cross-functional training sessions to encourage team members to learn about different aspects of the project.
- Start using a more proactive approach to issue tracking to address potential problems before they escalate.

## Lessons Learned

- Learned to balance insights gained from domain experts with practical considerations in data collection and modeling.
- Recognized the critical importance of focusing on data integrity and the need for a robust verification process.
- Acknowledged the significant impact of clear and comprehensive documentation on facilitating collaboration and replication.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Domain Understanding:

  - The initial plan for understanding the problem domain through collaboration with domain experts went as expected, providing valuable insights.

- Data Exploration:

  - The plan for thorough investigation of available data sources was successful, identifying relevant information for modeling.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Data Source Verification Delay:

  - The verification of data sources faced delays, impacting the overall timeline for data collection.

- Quantitative Data Oversight:

  - The initial plan did not adequately account for the consideration of quantitative data, requiring adjustments in the modeling approach.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Enhanced Data Verification Steps:

  - Additional steps for enhanced data source verification were added to ensure data reliability.

- Quantitative Data Integration:

  - The need for considering quantitative data became apparent, leading to the inclusion of quantitative aspects in the modeling strategy.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Streamlined Documentation Process:

  - Streamlined the documentation process by focusing on key information and removing unnecessary details, improving readability.

- Simplified Data Validation:

  - Simplified the data validation process by removing redundant steps, making it more efficient.
